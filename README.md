# paprika-ha

An **unofficial** Home Assistant Integration for Paprika Recipe Manager.

## Features

Currently the integration just exposes 4 calendars: one for each meal type, which allows you to see what meals have been planned in the App for a given day.

## Installing

This is still a very new integration, and what features are offered is going to change quite a lot in the short term. This means that for now you need to install this by adding a custom repository to HACS.

Instructions on how to do this are on the HACS Docs: https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/
